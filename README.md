Archer video enhancer circuit with additional pads for each transistor pin, input, output, and enhance potentiometer wiper. Use for auditioning components for circuit bending applications or as a standalone video enhancer/amplifier in a slim package.

The circuit is based on the Archer video enhancer trace posted by Psyingo on electro-music (https://electro-music.com/forum/topic-55059.html). See the Phobos trace of the Sima Edit2 (https://electro-music.com/forum/post-450558.html) which shares essentially the same circuit topology. I have not confirmed the values of the Sima trace.
