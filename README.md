Archer video enhancer circuit with additional pads for each transistor pin, input, output, and enhance potentiometer wiper. Use for auditioning components for circuit bending applications or as a standalone video enhancer/amplifier in a slim package.

The circuit is based on the Archer video enhancer trace posted by Psyingo on electro-music (https://electro-music.com/forum/topic-55059.html). See the Phobos trace of the Sima Edit2 (https://electro-music.com/forum/post-450558.html) which shares essentially the same circuit topology. I have not confirmed the values of the Sima trace.

ISSUES:
There is a misprint on the PCB. The 75ohm resistor closest to the 47nf capacitor should be changed to 10ohm or so. I think it's a 7.5ohm on Bastien's AVEMOD. 75ohm will pass signal but lowering this value is ideal.
